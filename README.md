# Processing Data in OpenRefine
Do you work with data in spreadsheets? This [JHU Data Services](https://dataservices.library.jhu.edu/) workshop will teach you how to process and standardize your tabular data efficiently and reproducibly using OpenRefine. OpenRefine is a free, open-source tool with a graphical user interface (GUI) to clean and organize data – no coding required! The bulk of this 2.5-hour workshop will be a hands-on tutorial processing a dataset in OpenRefine.   

After taking this workshop, participants will:    
- Understand the importance of processing and standardizing data​
- Be able to carry out several transformations in OpenRefine to standardize data for further analysis
- Leave with a test project that can be used to practice further data analysis or learn advanced features of OpenRefine, such as working with APIs
